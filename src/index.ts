  apple-podcasts-mcp                     Run over stdio. This is what an MCP client launches.
  apple-podcasts-mcp doctor              Check the setup and report what is wrong.
  apple-podcasts-mcp --http [--port=N]   Run over HTTP, for a machine that is always on.
  apple-podcasts-mcp --version           Print the version.
  apple-podcasts-cli                     List every tool as a shell command.
  apple-podcasts-cli <command> --help    What one command takes.

Most of this server needs no configuration. Apple's catalog, charts, reviews and
RSS feeds are all open, and the local library is read straight off this Mac.

Options:
  APPLE_PODCASTS_STOREFRONT         two-letter country code, default us. Apple's
                                    catalog, charts and reviews all differ by country
  APPLE_PODCASTS_STOREFRONTS        comma-separated markets the cross-market tools sweep
  APPLE_PODCASTS_LIBRARY=0          remove the local-library tools from the tool list
  APPLE_PODCASTS_LIBRARY_PATH       where the Podcasts database is, if not the default

For a show you own in Apple Podcasts Connect:
  APPLE_PODCASTS_VENDOR_NUMBER      vendor number from Podcasts Connect
  APPLE_PODCASTS_REPORTER_TOKEN     Reporter access token, expires after 180 days

Everything else:
  APPLE_PODCASTS_READ_ONLY=1        hide the one tool that writes a file
  APPLE_PODCASTS_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=0 keep the tool listed, refuse the write
  APPLE_PODCASTS_AUDIT_LOG          append-only log of every attempted write
  APPLE_PODCASTS_CACHE_TTL_MS       how long a fetched chart stays reusable, default 300000
  APPLE_PODCASTS_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS per-request deadline, default 30000
  APPLE_PODCASTS_MIN_REQUEST_INTERVAL_MS  spacing between requests, default 220
  APPLE_PODCASTS_MAX_RETRIES        retries on rate limits and 5xx, default 3
  APPLE_PODCASTS_USER_AGENT         override the User-Agent sent to Apple
  APPLE_PODCASTS_ITUNES_HOST        override the Search API host, for testing
  APPLE_PODCASTS_CHARTS_HOST        override the charts host, for testing
  APPLE_PODCASTS_REPORTER_HOST      override the Reporter host, for testing
  APPLE_PODCASTS_HTTP_PORT / _HOST / _TOKEN  for --http
