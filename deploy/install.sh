No credentials are needed. Apple's catalog, charts, reviews and podcast RSS
feeds are all open, and your own library is read straight off this Mac.

On macOS, the library tools need Full Disk Access for whichever app launches
the server (your terminal, or Claude Desktop):

  System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access

Add it, then quit and reopen that app. The permission is only read at launch.
